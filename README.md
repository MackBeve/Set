Set

J. Mack Beveridge

A java version of the Set card game

Run Set.java to play the game.  The program has two different modes, Classic Set and 6-Set.  Clasic Set is just like to card game where you find sets until you run out of cards in the deck.  6-Set is a sort of challenge where there are 12 cards with 6 different sets and you must find all 6.

Thanks to Michael Deallenbach for introducing me to the game.
